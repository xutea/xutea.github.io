<p>大家好，欢迎来到茶文化研究网站！我是网站北京师范大学附属实验中学 2025 届学生李卓远，为宣传中国茶文化而建立了本网站。</p>
<p>Hello everyone, welcome to the Tea Culture Research website! I am Li Zhuoyuan, a student from the Experimental High School Affiliated to Beijing Normal University, and I have established this website to promote Chinese tea culture.</p>
<p>茶最古老的源头是神农氏尝百草尝到了茶树。后来，茶文化自“茶圣”陆羽（中国唐代）写的《茶经》开始兴盛，至今为止中国的茶文化已经兴盛一千三百年左右。</p>

<p>The oldest origin of tea dates back to Shen Nong, the Divine Farmer, who tasted various herbs and discovered the tea plant. Later, tea culture began to flourish with the "Tea Sage" Lu Yu's (Tang Dynasty in China) writing of "The Classic of Tea," and to date, Chinese tea culture has been thriving for about 1,300 years.</p>
<p>“柴米油盐酱醋茶，琴棋书画诗酒茶。”茶也是唯一的雅俗共赏之物。</p>
<p>"Firewood, rice, oil, salt, soy sauce, vinegar, and tea; the seven daily necessities, and the seven arts of qin (zither), chess, calligraphy, painting, poetry, and wine, all share tea." Tea is also the only thing that is enjoyed by both the refined and the common people.</p>
<p>今年我 17 岁，上高中三年级，说起学茶的经历，还要从小学一年级开始，记得那是一个阳光正好，微风不燥的午后。身边的小伙伴们都纷纷走向英语、奥数、美术、书法、舞蹈等教室，唯独我步履轻盈地走进茶艺茶道教室。</p>

<p>This year, I am 17 years old and in my senior year of high school. Speaking of my journey of learning about tea, it started in the first grade of elementary school. I remember it was a sunny afternoon with a gentle breeze. I walked lightly into the tea art and tea ceremony classroom.</p>
<p>舒缓的古琴曲很有代入感，环顾四周，教室布置古朴典雅，“梅、兰、竹、菊”雕花装饰的家具庄重大气，摆着香炉的条案上方悬挂着“松风听禅”的书法作品，靠墙两张老榆木的茶桌儿很厚重，斑驳的磨损痕迹，仿佛述说着自己的经历，桌上布了茶席，精美的茶用具，有些我都叫不上名字。学位只有八席，此后的四年中，每周六下午都是我与这片神奇树叶的约会……</p>

<p>The soothing ancient zither music was very immersive. Looking around, the classroom was decorated in a simple and elegant style, with furniture carved with "plum, orchid, bamboo, chrysanthemum," exuding a solemn and grand atmosphere. A calligraphy piece reading "Pine Wind Listens to Zen" hung above the incense burner on the long table. Against the wall, two old elm tea tables were very substantial, with mottled wear marks that seemed to tell their own stories. The tea tables were set with tea mats and exquisite tea utensils, some of which I couldn't even name. For the next four years, every Saturday afternoon was my date with this magical leaf...</p>
<p>泡茶是一件非常神奇的事情。接受了现代教育的我，又有工业标准化生产理念加持，理论上讲，如果投入同样的茶，同样的水量，同样的水温，同样的出汤时间，那么泡出来的茶的滋味应该是一样。然而，神奇的是，事实并非如此。马燕老师曾让我们所有的人用同样的流程来泡同一款茶，事实证明，每一个人泡出来的茶都是不一样的。马老师经常说，你是否用心泡茶，喝一杯你泡的茶就知道了。一个人的性格以及他的内心世界，也会体现在你的茶汤中。这一点，我无法用现代科学来解释，但是事实上就是这样，每次马老师泡出来的茶，少了苦涩的味道，多了一份淡淡的甜味，在这个过程中并没有添加任何的糖类调味剂。于是我总觉得马老师的内心充满了爱，以至于茶经过了她的手，居然能变出淡淡的甜味。所以，泡茶，不仅仅是体现了一个人的技术水平，更加体现了他的内在修养。</p>

<p>Brewing tea is a very magical thing. Having received modern education and with the concept of industrial standardized production, theoretically speaking, if the same amount of tea, water, water temperature, and brewing time are used, the taste of the brewed tea should be the same. However, the magic is that this is not the case. Professor Ma Yan once had all of us follow the same process to brew the same type of tea, and it turned out that each person's tea was different. Professor Ma Yan often said, whether you brew tea with your heart can be known by drinking a cup of tea you've brewed. A person's character and his inner world are also reflected in your tea soup. I cannot explain this with modern science, but it is indeed the case. Every time Teacher Ma brewed tea, it had less bitter taste and more of a faint sweetness, without adding any sugar or flavoring agents. So I always felt that Professor Ma's heart was full of love, so much so that the tea, after passing through her hands, could actually produce a faint sweetness. Therefore, brewing tea is not only a reflection of a person's technical level but also a reflection of his inner cultivation.</p>

<p>陆羽在茶经中写到的“精行俭德之人最宜饮之”，要泡好一杯茶，要全心全意，认真投入。“五百次郑重其事的拿起，练就一次优雅从容的放下。”泡茶如此，对待生活和工作中的每一件事情、每一个人亦是如此。</p>

<p>Lu Yu wrote in "The Classic of Tea" that "those who practice frugality and virtue are most suitable to drink it." To brew a good cup of tea, one must be wholehearted and serious. "Five hundred times of solemnly picking up, just for one time of elegantly and calmly putting down." It is the same with brewing tea as it is with every matter and every person in life and work.</p>
<p>于是，我开始常常给长辈、同学、朋友泡茶，给同龄人讲茶。<img src="${about4}" align="left" width="40%" hspace="15" vspace="5" style="box-shadow: 0px 0.208333vw 0.833333vw rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.25);  border-radius:12px;"/>在学校组织茶文化研究社，建议大家用中国茶来代替奶茶和碳酸饮料，很多同学都加入到了我们的队伍中来。后来我们建立了中国茶网站，希望能在中学生中建立联盟，一同携手学习研究中国茶文化，一起来传承和发扬中国茶。我们的网站是一个科普公益型网站，欢迎大家一起加盟，感受中国茶带给我们的健康和意境。</p>
<p>Therefore, I began to often brew tea for elders, classmates, and friends, and talk about tea with peers. I organized a tea culture research club at school, suggesting that everyone use Chinese tea instead of sugar-sweetened beverage and carbonated drinks, and many students joined our club. Later, we established the Chinese Tea website, hoping to build an alliance among middle school students to learn and research Chinese tea culture together, and to inherit and promote Chinese tea. Our website is a scientific and public welfare website, and everyone is welcome to join and feel the health and artistic conception that Chinese tea brings to us.</p>

<p>Chinese tea culture has a long history, including not only the types and drinking of tea, but also the rich etiquette and philosophy. Tea is regarded as an art of life in China, carrying profound connotations of interpersonal communication and cultural inheritance. I hope to use this website to establish an alliance to spread Chinese tea culture among the majority of young students, and to promote this unique culture around the world. By organizing tea art performances, cultural lectures and tea tasting activities, we can explore the story and charm of tea more deeply, so as to stimulate people's love and recognition of this tradition, and jointly protect and inherit this precious cultural heritage.</p>
